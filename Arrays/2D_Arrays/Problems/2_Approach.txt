1. Brute Force:-
    Search for all numbers and if target found return true

2. Binary Search:-
    In our array rows and columns are sorted and you can see that smallest value is at [0,0] amd biggest at [rows-1][cols-1].
    So our mid can be either [0,rows-1] or [0,cols-1]. We use [0,rows-1] for the sake of simplicity. This position is top right corner.
    Now if our value is bigger than target then we move down in rows else if its smaller we move back in columns.
