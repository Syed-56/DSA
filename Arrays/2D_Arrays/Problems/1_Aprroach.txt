The Q says that each row of matrix is sorted and the first element of next row is larger than the last element of previous row.
So we can iterate over first element of each row and the moment first element become greater then target, we store the index of previous row. This will take single loop
Now the index of row we got we will search linearly and get the element.
IF element not found return false else return true.
