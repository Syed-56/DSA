First you will make 3 pointers: previous=NULL, current=head, next=NULL
now you will iterate until current becomes NULL
in the loop you will set next to current->next and set current->next to prev, if we set current->next to prev then the linked list is broken and we cant point to other nodes.
then prev is updated to be current and current is updated to be next, and in next iteration the next node is pointed by current->next again
