1) Push Front:-
    here you create a dynamic node which stores the passed value and points to null bcz of constructor
        head -> [20] -> [30] -> null  |   newNode = [10] -> nullptr
    then you set the pointer of this new node to the head of list, since head is the first value.
        [10] -> haed -> [20] -> [30] <-> tail -> null
    then we set the value of head as new node.
        head <-> [10] -> [20] -> [30] <-> tail -> null

    But what if the list is empty?
    The head by efault points to null so we add the node and then make head = newNode. and also update tail to point to newNode as it is both first and last node. In the case of non-empty linked list, we didn't need to touch tail as element is pushed from behind.

        head <-> tail <-> null |  node = [10] -> nullptr
        [10] -> head <-> tail -> null
        head <-> [10] <-> tail -> null
