Queue: Works on FIFO Principle (Element added first is removed first), like in an assembly line. []-[]-[]
    Element added first is called front and element added last is called rear. Push() removes front and Pop() removes rear.
    Push is here called enqueue() and pop is called dequeue(), All functionalities are O(1)
    This is a basic queue which is called linear queue as elements are linear

    In dequeue: first element is reduced and since first is pointed by front so now we have to point it at next element so we do front++
    In enqueue: last element is added and since it is pointed by rear so we increment rear++

Queue with linked list: It is very easy to apply is enqueue means new element is head and dequeue means head = head->next
A type of Queue is Dequeue where you can also access queue at back so you can implement pushFron pushBack popFront popBack all like linkedlist and you can also return rear

Circular Queue: A queue in which rear is connected with front (rear->next = front) and in array implementation its rear = (rear + 1) % MAX; front = (front + 1) % MAX;
    It has a limited size and fixed due to Circular structure
