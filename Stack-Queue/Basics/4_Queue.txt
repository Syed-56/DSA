Queue: Works on FIFO Principle (Element added first is removed first), like in an assembly line. []-[]-[]
    Element added first is called front and element added last is called rear. Push() removes front and Pop() removes rear.
    Push is here called enqueue() and pop is called dequeue(), All functionalities are O(1)
    This is a basic queue which is called linear queue as elements are linear

    In dequeue: first element is reduced and since first is pointed by front so now we have to point it at next element so we do front++
    In enqueue: last element is added and since it is pointed by rear so we increment rear++
