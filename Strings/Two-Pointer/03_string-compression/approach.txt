we will initialize count to 1 for each unique letter and add that letter in answer and then we compare if current letter and next letter are same (to dont reach out of bound when checking next letter we do i<n-1) we increment the count and iteration also so count dont reset.
Then we check if count has been increased so then we convert count integer to string and add its individual character to vector (this is because if we simply do it without loop we will get error for numbers >= 10). Then we set the answer string to given string for Q requirements and return the size of answer.
