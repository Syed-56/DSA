Two Pointer Approach :-
    we will compare start and end pointers and do typical algorithm and if comparison return false it means string is not palindrome.
    we compare them by converting to lowercase because string can be case sensitive as this language is.
    Also we check if a character is alphanumeric or not because question asks to remove alphanumeric characters.
