First we will reverse the whole string so that atleast the order of position of words is corrected and then we will reverse each individual word.
The words can be reversed by iterating over string until s[i] != " ", by iterating we store the word and then reverse it and after that we put it in our new answer string with a space. 
The above mentioned step will be repeated while i<n. The next iteration will be began when s[i] != " ", otherwise we will continue. because we dont want extra white spaces in our string.
If we somehow get extra spaces in end we run a loop to remove them.
